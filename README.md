## The Challenge

Create a simple chat app that utilizes sockets for real-time to learn the fundamentals of Socket.io. Use app to pass the time with family during pandemic lockdown.  App should allow family members logging into different devices, the ability to connect and pretend that we are not all trapped under the same roof together. :wink:
